<h2>About Public People</h2>

<p>Public People makes news more effective at supporting accountability and democracy.</p>

<p>It does this by showing news about a person of political or civic interest in reverse chronological order. Presenting historical articles in this way helps you find articles that you might not otherwise find easily; it lets you see how the conversation about someone changes over time; and it lets you see how one publication differs from another in angle on the same story.</p>

<h3>Roadmap and progress</h3>

<p>We currently show news related to a person based on their name occurring in an article. That means news mentioning John Smith will be shown for all John Smiths, which is not always correct. This is an early simplification and we welcome suggestions to improve on this (see Contributing)</p>

<p>We're working towards a Minimal Viable Product right now and just want to get it into peoples' hands.</p>

<p>The longer-term goal is to build an ecosystem of loosely connected tools that each do what they do well, and also provide data exports to support other related tools and more in-depth investigation. We're explicitly trying not to build one big central network analysis hub combining all possible sources of information about someone or trying to visualise someone’s influence network.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>The people featured on Public People are those who choose a role in politics or public administration.</p>

<p>The information featured about those people is limited to information that is</p>
<ul>
  <li>Legally obtained</li>
  <li>
    Relevant to the public interest
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. for the public to exercise their democratic rights</li>
      <li>This includes information needed to identify this person</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Practically, we use the press and government publications as a benchmark for what may be shown about someone.</p>
